Shimon is a robotic marimba player that has been developed over many years. After learning about expressive and fluid dancing from my thesis, I used some of this work to creatae new fluid and animate dances for shimon.

The new dances encorperate follow through and follow similar rules to my masters thesis with dancing robot arms. Working with Raghavasimhan Sankaranarayanan and Xuedan Gao, we created a framework for robotic musicians to improve synchronization, and cue different timings.
