Over our time working on Forest and Medusai, my advisor and I hosted sets of workshops to create dances with artists. We ended up creating performances that ranged from 12 minutes to an hour long

these workshops helped dancers come up with new ways to approach choreaography and performance. There is a special mindset required to perform with a robot in a way that makes both the dancer and the robot shine.  The robto will listen to you too much, but also not enough.

Typically, the first part of the workshops involve artists learning about how our tech works, with a lot of touching and trying to break the robots. This helps establish a foundational trust and understanding of boths strenghts and limits.

We then start to find new interactions and ways to push the robots. I then go home and code a "prototype version" of all the interactions we discuss.Then the artists play with all the interactions and whichever ones they like we start to refine.

With the more expressive versions of interactions, we start discussing the feel and look of the performance/piece.
