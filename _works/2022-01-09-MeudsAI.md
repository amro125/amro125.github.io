medusai is a multi-modal AI driven robotic sculpture that responds to and interacts with humans through sound, light, touch, and movement. Inspired by the Greek myth of Medusa, the sculpture features seven robotic arms in the form of "snake hair" installed on top of 8x10 ft. metallic "face" structure. Human movement around medusai is captured by a top mounted camera and an artificial vision tracking system drives the robotic arms to follow humans, pluck strings, and hit drums around its surface. medusai also responds with light and electronic sound to humans' activity such as drumming and plucking strings.

The project is inspired by the Ancient Greek myth of Medusa, who was born as a mortal maiden known for her beauty and good nature. After being raped and abused, Medusa was cursed by Athena to become a snake haired monster who turns anyone who looks at her to stone. The medusai project builds on this myth as a metaphor for the societal effects of AI in our current time. The project captures and reflects on the good intentions and promises of AI on one hand and the risks and threats on the other. The eerie and uncanny notion of AI-driven robotic snakes following and threatening humans is countered by the sculptureâ€™s potential to inspire humans - musicians, dancers, museum visitors -  to push the boundaries of their creativity and expression by interacting with the AI driven robotic sculpture.

 There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. Albums are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of photographs, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is stamp albums, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of postage stamps. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).

Hymnals are books with collections of musical hymns that can typically be found in churches. Prayerbooks or missals are books that contain written prayers and are commonly carried by monks, nuns, and other devoted followers or clergy. Lap books are a learning tool created by students.

Dummy books (or faux books) are books that are designed to imitate a real book by appearance to deceive people, some books may be whole with empty pages, others may be hollow or in other cases, there may be a whole panel carved with spines which are then painted to look like books,  titles of some books may also be fictitious.

The advent of paperback books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in pulp magazines. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.
