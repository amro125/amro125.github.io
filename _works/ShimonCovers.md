We used stem separation to seperate the lyrics from instrumentals. We then converted the instrumental audio to MIDI and applied a "shimonizer" to it. This allowed the notes to be played in a way that is possible based on shimons morphology.

We then got the lyrics and pitch data to generate a shimon specific voice and produced various coer songs to play at Georgia Techs Booth at SC24
