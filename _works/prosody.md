When someone complains "it's not what you said, its how you said it." They can be refering to one of two things: your word choice or your use of prosody. Prosody refers to your audible presentation of words to convey a specific tone or emotion. For example, raising the pitch at the end of a phrase implies that its a quesion.

We created emotional musical phrases (Refer to Richard Savery's PhD thesis on how he lead this awesome project). to convey specific emotions. In addition, we wanted the robots to have specific gestures to match such emotions. 

This was also the first project I worked on at GTCMT, we wanted to create emotonal gestures for non humanoid robots that would accompany our emotional musical prosody. To do this, we looked at how humans use gestures in their postures (similar to Eckmans Facial Action Coding System) and created our own framework for designing gestures for non humanoid robots. This involved some degree of freedom reduction and mapping human morphology to robot arm morphology (yes, this foreshadowing some of my MOCAP dance work).

We ended up using this framework/ gestures to express different personalities with robots, create emotional contagion, and change a users perceived entitativity with a group of robots.
